# Time Capsule

Time Capsule is a powerful tool designed to continuously capture and store your digital activities, creating a comprehensive digital memory. Currently, it focuses on audio capture and transcription, with plans to expand to other forms of digital activity logging and advanced memory recall features.

## üöß Work in Progress üöß

**DISCLAIMER: Time Capsule is currently under heavy construction. Many features mentioned in this README are planned but not yet implemented. The current version focuses primarily on audio capture and transcription.**

## ‚ú® Current Features

- üéôÔ∏è Real-time microphone recording
- üó£Ô∏è Speech-to-text transcription using Fast-Whisper library
- ‚öôÔ∏è Configurable language and confidence settings (`config/config.py`)
- üíæ Database storage of transcribed text using Chroma vector database

## üöÄ Future Features

- ü§ñ LLM integration for natural language interaction with your digital memory
- üß† Advanced memory recall capabilities, allowing users to query their digital history
- üìä Expanded data capture (screen recordings, typed text, etc.)

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/TheSethRose/Time-Capsule.git
   cd Time-Capsule
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `.venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Configure settings in `config/config.py` according to your preferences.

## üñ•Ô∏è Usage

Start capturing audio:

```bash
python main.py
```

Press `Ctrl+C` to stop the application.

## üìù Planned Functionality

Future versions of Time Capsule aim to provide a seamless interface for interacting with your digital memory. Example queries:

- "What did we agree upon in that meeting last Thursday?"
- "When is my doctor's appointment?"
- "How much was my electricity bill?"
- "What was the last message I sent to my partner?"

These features will leverage Chroma vector database and large language models to provide accurate, context-aware responses based on your captured digital activities.
