## ‚ùì Problem Statement
- Existing AI memory tools are often closed-source & controlled by for-profit companies
- Users have privacy concerns about trusting a company with recording & storing all their digital activity
- Subscription costs can be prohibitive for many potential users

## ‚úÖ Proposed Solution
- Create an open source alternative called "Time Capsule" that is self-hosted & gives users full control over their data
- Develop the project in Python to leverage its extensive ecosystem of open source libraries and ensure cross-platform compatibility
- Utilize existing open source technologies like OpenAI Whisper for speech-to-text & Tesseract OCR for text extraction
- Provide easy deployment options for self-hosting on a user's own infrastructure / devices
- Ensure compatibility with MacOS, Windows & Linux

## üéØ Target Audience
- Tech-savvy Python developers who value privacy & want control over their data
- Open source enthusiasts who can contribute to the project & help enhance its capabilities
- Productivity-focused users who want AI-assisted memory without high subscription costs

## ‚≠ê Key Features
- Continuous recording of screen at 0.5 FPS, audio & typed text across all apps
- Searchable archive of everything seen, said & heard on the device
- Local storage & processing of data to protect user privacy
- Fully open source Python codebase that can be audited, modified & improved by the community
- Self-hosting to avoid dependence on cloud services & maintain data sovereignty
- Optimized performance using FFmpeg for H.264 encoding to minimize impact on system resources & battery life
- Encrypted storage using AES encryption with user-provided passwords for enhanced security
- Cross-platform compatibility with MacOS, Windows & Linux, providing a consistent user experience and feature set
- Modular architecture to facilitate contributions & extensibility
- Intuitive user interface for easy navigation, search & playback of recordings

## üëç Benefits
- Empowers users with increased privacy & complete control over their data
- Enables customization & extensibility through an open source Python codebase
- Eliminates subscription fees, allowing users to run Time Capsule for free
- Provides transparency through open source code that can be examined & verified
- Offers a decentralized architecture that enhances resilience & avoids single points of failure
- Runs efficiently on user devices without taxing system resources / battery life
- Supports multiple operating systems, making it accessible to a wider audience
- Fosters a community-driven development model that encourages collaboration & innovation

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Potential Challenges
- Achieving performance & efficiency comparable to proprietary solutions as an open source project
- Balancing ease of use with the complexity of self-hosting for non-technical users
- Providing comprehensive documentation & support for a diverse user base
- Ensuring the security & privacy of locally stored sensitive data
- Managing the complexity of cross-platform development & testing
- Building a strong community & attracting contributors to the project
- Ensuring the long-term sustainability & maintenance of the project

## üë£ Next Steps
- Conduct a thorough evaluation of suitable open source libraries & components to leverage
- Research and select cross-platform libraries and frameworks for screen recording, audio recording, OCR, and speech-to-text that are compatible with Python and work well on MacOS, Windows, and Linux
- Define a clear roadmap & milestones for the project, including the minimum viable product (MVP) features
- Set up a development environment & establish coding guidelines & best practices
- Implement core functionality such as screen recording, audio recording, OCR & speech-to-text
- Design & implement a modular & extensible architecture that facilitates contributions
- Develop a user-friendly interface for searching, navigating & interacting with recorded data
- Optimize performance & resource usage to ensure efficient continuous recording across platforms
- Implement robust security measures, including encryption & secure deletion of sensitive data
- Provide comprehensive documentation, including installation guides, user manuals & API references, with platform-specific instructions for MacOS, Windows, and Linux
- Establish a project website & community channels for user support, feedback & engagement
- Actively seek contributions & feedback from the open source community to drive the project forward
- Explore potential partnerships / collaborations with other open source projects / organizations
- Continuously iterate & improve the project based on user feedback & evolving requirements
- Ensure thorough testing and compatibility across MacOS, Windows, and Linux throughout the development process
