1. Screen Recording
   - Use the PyAutoGUI library to capture screenshots at a fixed interval of 2 seconds (0.5 FPS).
   - Store the screenshots temporarily as PNG files.
   - Implement a background process that continuously captures screenshots and saves them to a designated directory.
   - Provide configuration options for screenshot interval and output directory.
   - Use platform-specific libraries (e.g., AppKit on macOS, UIAutomation on Windows, Xlib on Linux) to identify and filter out excluded apps and private browser windows.

2. Audio Recording
   - Use the sounddevice library to capture audio from the default microphone at a sample rate of 44.1 kHz.
   - Integrate with the OpenAI Whisper library to perform real-time speech-to-text conversion.
   - Save the converted text transcripts along with timestamps in JSON format.
   - Implement a background process that continuously records audio in 5-minute chunks, converts it to text, and saves the transcripts.
   - Provide configuration options for audio device selection and transcript storage.

3. Optical Character Recognition (OCR)
   - Use the Tesseract OCR library to extract text from the captured screenshots.
   - Preprocess the screenshots using OpenCV to enhance text visibility (e.g., apply thresholding, remove noise).
   - Perform text localization using Tesseract's page segmentation modes to identify regions of interest within the screenshots.
   - Apply OCR to the identified regions and extract the text content.
   - Save the extracted text along with the corresponding screenshot timestamps in JSON format.
   - Implement a background process that performs OCR on the captured screenshots at a configurable interval (e.g., every 5 seconds) and saves the extracted text.

4. Typed Text Capturing
   - Use the pynput library to monitor and capture typed text across different applications.
   - Implement event listeners to capture key presses and store the typed text in memory.
   - Periodically save the captured typed text to a JSON file with timestamps at a configurable interval (e.g., every 30 seconds).
   - Provide configuration options for enabling/disabling typed text capture and specifying the storage format and interval.

5. Data Storage and Indexing
   - Use SQLite as the lightweight database system to store and manage the recorded data.
   - Design a database schema with tables for screen recordings (video chunks), audio transcripts, extracted text, and typed text.
   - Implement indexing on timestamp columns to enable fast searching and retrieval of data based on time ranges.
   - Provide an API or query interface to search and retrieve specific data points based on user-defined criteria (e.g., keywords, time ranges).
   - Optimize the database structure by partitioning data into separate tables or databases based on time ranges (e.g., monthly) to improve query performance and manageability.

6. Video Encoding
   - Use FFmpeg to encode the captured screenshots into H.264 video format.
   - Compress the screenshots directly to H.264 video using FFmpeg's libx264 encoder, avoiding temporary storage as PNG files to reduce I/O overhead.
   - Utilize hardware acceleration for video encoding when available (e.g., NVENC on NVIDIA GPUs, VideoToolbox on macOS, MediaCodec on Android) to improve performance and reduce CPU usage.
   - Store the encoded video files in a designated directory with timestamps as filenames (e.g., "screen_recording_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.mp4").
   - Implement a background process that periodically encodes the captured screenshots into video chunks of a configurable duration (e.g., 5 minutes).

7. User Interface
   - Develop a cross-platform user interface using the PyQt framework.
   - Create intuitive screens for searching, browsing, and viewing the recorded data.
   - Implement search functionality that allows users to query data based on keywords, timestamps, or other criteria.
   - Provide playback options for screen recordings and audio transcripts, with controls for play, pause, seek, and speed adjustment.
   - Enable users to export selected data points in common formats such as CSV and PDF.
   - Incorporate features for starring important moments, bulk deletion, and privacy management.

8. Security and Privacy
   - Implement AES encryption using the PyCryptodome library to secure stored data.
   - Encrypt video files, audio transcripts, and text data on disk using a user-provided password.
   - Use secure key derivation functions (e.g., PBKDF2) to generate encryption keys from user passwords.
   - Provide options for configurable data retention policies and secure data deletion.
   - Allow users to exclude specific apps or windows from recording based on platform-specific mechanisms (e.g., window class names, process names).
   - Implement features for bulk deletion of recordings by app, time range, or other criteria.

9. Performance Optimization
   - Implement techniques to reduce the impact on system resources and battery life.
   - Optimize video encoding by using hardware acceleration and appropriate encoding settings (e.g., bitrate, resolution) based on user preferences and system capabilities.
   - Explore options to subsample or defer OCR and speech-to-text processing when running on battery power or under high system load.
   - Utilize caching mechanisms to store frequently accessed data in memory for faster retrieval.
   - Monitor and profile the application using tools like cProfile and py-spy to identify performance bottlenecks and optimize resource utilization.

10. Cross-Platform Compatibility
    - Utilize cross-platform libraries and frameworks (e.g., PyQt, FFmpeg, SQLite) to ensure compatibility with MacOS, Windows, and Linux.
    - Test and optimize the application on each supported platform to ensure consistent performance and user experience.
    - Provide platform-specific installation and configuration guides for users, including dependencies and system requirements.
    - Address any platform-specific challenges or limitations that arise during development, such as file system access, permissions, or library availability.

11. Documentation and Community Support
    - Write comprehensive documentation covering installation, configuration, and usage instructions for the Time Capsule project.
    - Provide API documentation and code examples to facilitate integration and extension by developers.
    - Set up a community forum or discussion platform (e.g., GitHub Discussions, Discourse) to foster collaboration, knowledge sharing, and support among users and contributors.
    - Establish contribution guidelines and a code of conduct to encourage a welcoming and inclusive community.

12. Deployment and Distribution
    - Provide detailed installation instructions and dependencies for each supported platform.
    - Create distribution packages (e.g., executables, installers) using tools like PyInstaller or py2app for easy installation on different platforms.
    - Explore options for automated updates and bug fixes using mechanisms like GitHub Releases or a custom update server.
    - Consider publishing Time Capsule on package managers (e.g., pip, Homebrew) for easy installation and updates, along with platform-specific packages (e.g., .deb, .rpm) for Linux distributions.
